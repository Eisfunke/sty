Overview
========


Description
-----------

Simple, flexible and extensible string styling for your terminal.
Supports 3/4bit, 8bit and 24bit (truecolor, rgb) colors. Should work on
most Unix platfroms with most terminals. Recent versions of Windows 10
should work with this as well.

If you run into compatibility problems with sty, please file an issue!

Sty has no dependencies.


Goal
----

The idea is to provide Python with a little string styling markup, which
is decoupled from color palettes and terminal implementations.

Sty comes with default color palettes and renderers, but you can easily
replace/customize them with new ones, without touching the markup.


Requirements
------------

Sty requires Python ``>= 3.5``
